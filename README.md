Includes synthetic data, perceived risk levels, perception rules and partial coding.

scene features: including environment features and vehicle features. 
The environment features consist of nine indicators: time, cloudiness, precipitation, road water accumulation, wind, fog density, fog distance, wetting intensity, and road type For simplicity of subsequent expression, we have sampled the following illustrations: I is straight road, R is circle road, T is T-intersection, X is cross intersection. 
The vehicle features include seven indicators: vehicle HSV value, vehicle type, vehicle distance, pitch angle, heading angle, cross-roll angle, and traffic flow. According to the rules of the RSS model, the vehicles at risk are mainly the nearest frontal vehicles and lateral vehicles.
